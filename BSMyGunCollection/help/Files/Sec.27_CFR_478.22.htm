<p ALIGN="LEFT">records to portable data storage devices instead of printing out such

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has received
inquiries</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">from members of the firearms industry for whom ATF has approved a variance
permitting</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">the maintenance of required acquisition and disposition records on
computer. Most of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">these variances require licensees to periodically print a hard copy of the
record and store</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">the printout as part of their permanent records. Licensees have asked ATF
whether they</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">may download this information to portable data storage devices instead of
printing out the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">information.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44,
requires each</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer to maintain
such records of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of
firearms at his or</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">her place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney
General may by</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">regulations prescribe. 18 U.S.C. 923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General has
delegated the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">authority to administer and enforce the GCA to the Director, ATF. 28 CFR
0.130.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Regulations in 27 CFR Part 478 implement the provisions of the GCA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Subpart H of 27 CFR Part 478 specifies the records required to be created
and maintained</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">by an FFL. Subpart H generally requires that a record of an FFL&#146;s
acquisition and</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">disposition of firearms be maintained in what is commonly referred to as a
&quot;bound book.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">See 27 CFR 478.122 (importers); 478.123 (manufacturers); and 478.125
(dealers and</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">collectors). These regulations specifically allow ATF to authorize an FFL
to maintain</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">alternate records when it is shown that such alternate records will
accurately and readily</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">disclose the information required to be kept. The regulations further
require that an FFL</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">who proposes to use alternate records must submit a letter application to
ATF describing</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">the alternate records and the need therefor. Such alternate records shall
not be employed</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">by the FFL until approval is received from ATF.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, 27 CFR 478.22 allows for the approval and use of an alternate
method or</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in Part
478. ATF may</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">approve an alternate method or procedure when it is found that &#150;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- 2 -</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and
consistent with the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure and
that the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">alternate method or procedure is substantially equivalent to that
specifically</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">prescribed method or procedure; and</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any
provision of law and</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the
effective</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">administration of 27 CFR Part 478.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ATF recognizes that many businesses rely upon computers to maintain
records of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">inventory, sales, customer lists and other business information. Creating
and maintaining</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">records in a computer database, rather than in paper form, is accepted
throughout the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">business community as a reliable, cost-efficient means of maintaining
business records.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ATF has approved a significant number of variances allowing an FFL to
maintain</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">computerized acquisition and disposition records instead of the
handwritten bound book.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ATF routinely approves requests to utilize computerized records, finding
that the use of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">such records is substantially equivalent to the methods set forth in
Subpart H of 27 CFR</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Part 478. All approvals of such variances are conditional and may be
withdrawn at any</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the conditions that ATF generally places on an FFL receiving such a
variance is</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">that the FFL must periodically print out acquisition and disposition
records from the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">computer system. In this regard, ATF usually mandates that the FFL print
out the records:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(1) at least semiannually; (2) upon the request of an ATF official; (3)
when the database is</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">purged; and (4) when the license is terminated. When requested, ATF has
authorized an</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">FFL to download the required acquisition and disposition records to
portable storage</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">devices such as Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), and
USB Flash</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Drives, instead of conducting the periodic printout of those records,
provided that the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">records are capable of being presented in a printed format at ATF&#146;s
request. ATF</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">recognizes that printed records take up space and are not as easy to
search as records</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">maintained in a digital format.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Accordingly, ATF believes that good cause exists for authorizing the use
of computers and</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">portable storage devices to maintain the records of acquisition and
disposition of firearms</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">required by 27 CFR Part 478. The use of computers and portable storage
devices to</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">maintain required acquisition and disposition records, contingent upon the
requirements</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">outlined in the approved variance, is consistent with the intent of the
GCA, as it will result</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">in a permanent, reliable record that will accurately indicate acquisitions
and dispositions of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">firearms and armor piercing ammunition. Allowing flexibility through
variances</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">permitting the downloading and maintenance of records on portable storage
devices will</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">increase the effective administration of the GCA by ATF.</font><font
FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT"><i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Held</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">, FFLs holding an approved
variance to keep required records on computer may</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">periodically (at periods specified in the variance) download such records

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- 3 -</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">storage media, such as CDS, DVDs, and USB Flash Drives instead of
periodically printing</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">out such records under the following conditions:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. The FFL has received an approved computer recordkeeping variance from
ATF.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. The records must be downloaded to portable storage media at the time
periods</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">specified in the original variance, and in any event at least
semiannually.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. The FFL and the computer system in use by the FFL must have the
capability of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">printing required records at ATF&#146;s request.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. The records must be printed and stored as part of the FFL&#146;s
permanent records</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">when the database is purged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">5. The records must be printed and maintained as part of the FFL&#146;s
permanent records</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">when the license is terminated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If administrative difficulties arise through the use of portable storage
media instead of</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">paper printouts, the FFL will be required to provide periodic paper
printouts of such</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">records at the request of the Director of Industry Operations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">FFLs must comply with all other provisions of 27 CFR Part 478 as
prescribed.</font></p>
