<p>To Add Information, just click on the <font color="#0000FF">Add</font> button and the
top left of details window.&nbsp; Once you click on that, the following window will
appear.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Maintenance_Details_Blank.jpg" alt="Adding_Maintenance_Details_Blank.jpg (24883 bytes)" WIDTH="422" HEIGHT="312"></p>

<p><u><big><strong><a name="maintpaln">Selecting a Maintenance Plan</a></strong></big></u></p>

<p>Select the Maintenance Plan that you performed on the selected firearm.&nbsp; If you
forget which maintenance plan is which, you can click on the the little tools icon (
&nbsp; <img src="images/_14_32x32.gif" alt="_14_32x32.gif (1257 bytes)" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">&nbsp; )&nbsp; to
view the selected maintenance plan.</p>

<p><u><strong><big><a name="od">Operation Dates</a></big></strong></u></p>

<p>The Operation date can be used to mark when the firearm was used or when you started
the selected maintenance.</p>

<p><br>
The Operation Due Date is use for when the Maintenance was completed.</p>

<p><br>
Once you have selected the Operations Date and Due Date, you can also select the number of
rounds that you used since the last time that you performed maintenance on the selected
firearm.</p>

<p><u><strong><big><a name="Rounds">Rounds Fired since last Maintenance</a></big></strong></u></p>

<p>In Version 1 and 2 of the My Gun Collection application, if you used the maintenance
plans as well as the Ammunition Inventory features, then when you had to add maintenance
to a firearm after using it at the range and putting 100 round of practice rounds, plus a
few ballistic tests, you would have to put the end total in the &quot;Rounds Fired since
last Maintenance&quot; section, then you would have to go to the Ammunition Inventory
section and Manually Subtract from the number there.&nbsp; Took more time if anything.
&nbsp; But something new was released in version 3.x.</p>

<p>The <a name="ac">Ammo Calculator</a> was added to the version 3.x release.&nbsp; If you
do not wish to use this feature just skip to the <a href="#Notes">Notes</a> Section.</p>

<p>You can still do the old method if you wish, but if you wanted your Ammunition
inventory to be updated as well, then you can use the ammo calculator by clicking on the
calculator (&nbsp; <img src="images/calc1a.gif" alt="calc1a.gif (338 bytes)" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">&nbsp; )
&nbsp; icon, which will bring up the following window.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/AmmoCalc_Blank.jpg" alt="AmmoCalc_Blank.jpg (19747 bytes)" WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="346"></p>

<p>As you know, if you have ammunition listed in the Ammunition Inventory, when you are
viewing a firearm, it will pull all the ammunition from the ammunition inventory that
matches the Caliber and Pet Load that is used and will display with the Details of the
selected firearm.&nbsp; The Same applies here, where it will list only the ammunition that
matches that list. </p>

<p>All you have to do is select the brand of ammunition that you used, once selected it
will display how much you have listed in inventory.</p>

<p>Type in the number of rounds that you used from that brand and Click on the <font color="#0000FF">Add</font> button.</p>

<p>Repeat these steps until you have selected all that you have used for this firearm.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/AmmoCalc_Filled.jpg" alt="AmmoCalc_Filled.jpg (24787 bytes)" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="344"></p>

<p>Once you have selected all the ammunition that was used, you can see that it keeping
track of the total number of rounds that you used.</p>

<p>If you want the calculator to update you Ammunition inventory, make sure the
&quot;Update inventory&quot; check box is selected ( it is on by default ).</p>

<p>Once you are finished, click on <font color="#0000FF">Finish</font> button, to have the
total number of rounds transferred to the maintenance window.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Maintenance_Details_Filled.jpg" alt="Adding_Maintenance_Details_Filled.jpg (26999 bytes)" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="310"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong><big><a name="Notes">Notes</a></big></strong></u></p>

<p>The Notes section is more for your own use on why you where out on the range or what
you where doing with that firearm.&nbsp; It's just an added option for your own personal
use.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Maintenance_Details_Filled.jpg" alt="Adding_Maintenance_Details_Filled.jpg (26999 bytes)" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="310"></p>

<p><u><strong><big><a name="End">Finish</a></big></strong></u></p>

<p>Once you are finished adding data, just click on the <font color="#0000FF">Add</font>
button add this information to the database for the selected firearm.&nbsp; Once you click
add, it will refresh the list for the firearm details, as well as update the Total Rounds
Fired and Average Round Fired stats.</p>
