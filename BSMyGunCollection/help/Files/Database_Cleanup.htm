<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The database clean utility was created to help wipe out the entire
database of all the pre-loaded data.&nbsp; You can have it perform a Remove All Data,
which will wipe out everything, allowing you to start 100% fresh or you can select certain
preloaded catagories to remove from the database.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you already have your collection listed in the database and you just want to get rid
of all the extra models and Manufacturers that you don't use then you can still use this
utility.&nbsp; We've also kept in mind that this might occur, so if it will also check to
see if the Model, Manufacturers, Shops, Nationalities, Buyers, and Grip Types are not
being used by the firearms currently listed in the collection, if they are it will leave
it alone.</p>
