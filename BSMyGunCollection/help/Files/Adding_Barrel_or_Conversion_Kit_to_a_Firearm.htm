<p>Here is a regular view of an AR-15 with both .223 and 5.56 calibers listed, this is
what you currently see in the regular version.</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem01.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem01.jpg (87193 bytes)" width="849" height="513"></p>

<p>On the tool bar, the second icon from the left will have a new button that will allow
you to add a barrel or conversion kit to the current firearm.</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem02.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem02.jpg (10164 bytes)" width="223" height="113"></p>

<p>It will close out the view, and bring up another window with a form for you to fill
out. As you can see some information from the current firearm<br>
were copied over to the form. Which of course of that information did change then you can
change it manually.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem03.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem03.jpg (39686 bytes)" width="349" height="459"></p>

<p><br>
In this example we are going to add a .50 Beowulf upper to the AR.</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem04.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem04.jpg (38356 bytes)" width="343" height="455"><br>
<br>
As you can see the caliber changed, the barrel lenght and overall length changed, the feed
system, sights, price and store location where<br>
changed as well. (The price and location will not change in the main view at this time)</p>

<p><br>
Once you are finished you click on the Add button, and it will bring up the view of the
firearm you were last looking at.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem05.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem05.jpg (88512 bytes)" width="863" height="513"><br>
<br>
Since I did not select it as the default system, it kept the old information intact.
However you should notice a new tab is displaying called<br>
&quot;Barrels/Conversion Kits&quot;, when you click on this tab it will show you the
barrels and conversion kits that you have for this firearm including the<br>
default barrel.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem06.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem06.jpg (37062 bytes)" width="719" height="187"><br>
<br>
Maintenance and the Gun Smith section for this Barrel/Conversion Kit you will need to
select it as default. </p>

<p><u><strong><big><a name="default">Setting the default Barrel/Conversion Kit</a></big></strong></u></p>

<p>Just click on the system a right click to<br>
bring up a menu, and select &quot;Set as Default&quot;</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem07.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem07.jpg (11832 bytes)" width="343" height="137"><br>
<br>
When the information refreshes for the firearm it will change some of the information in
the details view.</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem08.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem08.jpg (78781 bytes)" width="653" height="519"><br>
<br>
Now such things as the Ammunition, Maintenance, and GunSmith section has been updated to
accomidate the new system.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem09.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem09.jpg (47112 bytes)" width="727" height="531"></p>

<p><img src="images/BarrelSystem10.jpg" alt="BarrelSystem10.jpg (32543 bytes)" width="717" height="225"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see in the maintenance picture above The Total Rounds Fired and Average
rounds fired aer at 0 since there are no entries for this<br>
upper. but in the fire right corner there is a new tag called &quot;Total Rounds of
Firearm:&quot; which has the total of all the rounds fired with the default<br>
system and any barrel or conversion kits that are used on this firearm.</p>

<p><br>
This was a major update to get this in place and we are still adding it to all the little
bits and pieces of the application to make sure everything<br>
works. So it's been taking awhile to complete.</p>

<p><br>
And Here is a quick shot of how it looks in the final report:<br>
