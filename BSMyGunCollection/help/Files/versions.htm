<ol>
  <li><p class="MsoNormal">FIXED - There was a glitch in the Ammunition Inventory Report that
    would not display the reports unless you had the &quot;Use Personal Markings&quot; enabled
    for the reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="MsoNormal">FIXED - There was an issue with linking the Same buyer by Name. If
    you sold a firearm to an existing customer, it will create a new buyer instead of linking
    him with his past account.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="MsoNormal">Added the Ability to create Custom Reports. This should take care
    of most the requests that we were getting about being able to create custom reports,
    however this is a new process which will more then likely be a work in progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="MsoNormal">Added to Total Rounds in Invetory Status label in the Ammunition

    running properly under Windows Vista. This was resolved by embedding in the application to
    run as an Administrator. Now under Windows Vista, you will get prompt from the UAC if you
    wish to run this application as administrator. See Wiki Article KB243 for more
    information.</p>

  <li><p class="MsoNormal">Help File - Updated the Ammunition Inventory Section with the new

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><big><big><a name="v4">Version 4.0 (October 2009)</a></big></big></strong></p>
<b>

<p>Summary: 6 Fixes, 27 Additions, 1 Change around in Interface.</b> 

<ol>
  <li>FIXED - Importer does not show while viewing a firearm, only when you edit the firearm
    does it appear.</li>
  <li>FIXED - Insurance Report By Default - Not Set to Landscape by Default</li>
  <li>FIXED - Insurance Report By Insured Value - Not Set to Landscape by Default</li>
  <li>Main Display (Side List ) - Add Sort by Catalog Number Option in drop down</li>
  <li>Simple Inventory List - Needs Sort by for Custom Catalog No</li>
  <li>Added a link to Misc Firearm and Reloading Links. This is just a web link to firearm
    related sites from our wiki.</li>
  <li>Added REMANUFACTURED DATE and a PLACE OF IMPORT for C&amp;R Collectors.</li>
  <li>Added the Ability to Use Alpha-Numeric (Default setting) or Numeric System for Custom
    Catalog ID. Since some Collectors use a Alpha-Numeric System for their collection, this
    was the default notion, however there are those that will just use a numeric system for
    their catalog. In order to Fix the reports for the Numeric Users we added this option.</li>
  <li>Added the Ability to Delete A Buyer from the List. It will allow you to delete a buyer
    that does not have a firearm listed to them, if it detects that there is a firearm
    attached to the buyer it will abort the delete.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to select a previous buyer when you are selling a firearm. This way
    you do not have to enter in the information again since it will already be on file.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to export the Firearm details, accessories, maintenance details, and
    Gun Smith Details to an XML file. This method was created for sale and transfers of
    firearms. If the Sell and buyer both have this program then the seller can export to
    details of the firearm to the buyer, then the buyer will be able to import the information
    to their collection. This way you can have a true running detail of the firearm and all
    that has been done to it from the past owner(s).</li>
  <li>Added the ability to import firearms that where exported to XML from another User of the
    My Gun Collection program. If you bought or received a firearm from another person or
    dealer, and they export the details of the firearm to XML, you can import the information
    that they had listed for that firearm. This way you can actually know how many rounds
    where fired and the Gun Smith details before you owned the firearm. This can help if a
    firearm is known for needing a part replaced after 5000 or 1000 rounds.</li>
  <li>Changed the location of the Edit Details, Close, and Full Details Report Buttons from
    the bottom of the form to a tool bar located at the top. This was done to give us the
    ability to add more options to this form and more display room for the details.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to save the last category for the firearm list that you where viewing.
    Let's say you had your firearms listed by Non C &amp; R when you exited the program, it
    will now save that spot for next time you load the program.</li>
  <li>Added the Option to Auto Assign for the Custom ID Field when in Integer/Numeric mode.</li>
  <li>Application Updater - Add the Ability or option to restart the My Gun Collection
    Application if there are no Updates.</li>
  <li>Added the feature of retaining the last firearm that you viewed or select the firearm
    that you just added. Before if the Firearm list refreshed, it will select the first
    firearm in the list, if you had 50 or more firearms it would be a hassle to have to look
    through the list for the firearm that you just added for you can add pictures and other
    details. This option will now select the last firearm that was added or the last firearm
    that was viewed after a refresh.</li>
  <li>FIXED - Compiled the applications to run as x86 mode instead of any CPU. The Any CPU
    mode was the reason why it would not work under windows 64-Bit, but change it to x86, it
    will allow the application to run as a true 32-Bit Process which will work in the Windows
    64-Bit Environment.</li>
  <li>Added the Ability to Add and Edit the date a firearm was sold. When you are adding the
    information of who bought the firearm, you can now select the date that it was sold. When
    you edit a firearm you can now edit the Sold Date.</li>
  <li>Added a visible marker for firearms that were sold. When you click on a firearm and it
    was sold, there is now a visible marker that will tell you that the item was sold and
    display the date when the item was sold.</li>
  <li>Added a &#147;Full Detailed Report&#148;, this is an Option next to the Old Detailed
    Report. The Full Detailed Report will also print out Maintenance, Accessories and Gun
    Smith Details along with the Regular Details. The Full Detailed Report is the Gold/Brown
    Printer Icon </li>
  <li>Added Quick Links to Detailed Report and Full Detailed Report to the right click menu
    for the firearm list.</li>
  <li>FIXED &#150; The Ammunition Inventory report to take up most of the Page. Before it
    would print in Landscape Mode but would not use of the page, this was changed the some of
    the fields where increased in width to help take up the rest of the page.</li>
  <li>Added the Total Number in Inventory to the end of the Ammunition Inventory Report. Since
    the regular Inventory window has the total number of rounds in your Ammunition Inventory,
    this feature was expanded to the Report itself.</li>
  <li>Added Insurance Forms with the Total Sum of the Price of the collection listed at the
    end of the report.</li>
  <li>Added Total Rounds Fired to the Maintenance Reports.</li>
  <li>While viewing the detail of the firearm, you are able to view the ammunition that is
    available for that firearm, now you can create a report from that same view that will
    allow you to sort and print the ammunition in that caliber.</li>
  <li>FIXED &#150; minor Glitch while viewing the details of a firearm in the ammunition
    section, the total number of rounds was not including Pet loads in the Total.</li>
  <li>Added the Final sale price. The Sale price was originally set as the appraised value,
    which needed to be set to the final sale price before marking it as sold. Now you can put
    in the final sale price when you are marking the item as sold. This will update the
    appraised value field.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to filter by Manufacturer, Caliber and or Grain while viewing the
    Ammunition inventory List.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to filter by Manufacturer and or place to Buy while viewing the Wish
    list.</li>
  <li>While viewing the details of a firearm in the Accessories Tab, you can now filter out by
    manufacturer.</li>
  <li>While viewing the details of a firearm in the Maintenance Tab, you can now filter out by
    maintenance plan.</li>
  <li>While viewing the details of a firearm in the Gun Smith Tab, you can now filter out by
    Gun Smith.<br>
