<p>The ability to Import and Export the Detail of a firearm was created to allow users to
export the firearm's details, accessories, maintenance, and gun smith details to a XML
file, which can be used to import into another database, application or on the web.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Our main goal on this feature, was to give the users the ability to give such
information to the buyer or seller of the firearm.&nbsp; If you sold a firearm to someone
and they used the My Gun Collection application to track their collection as well, then
you can give them this XML file and they can import it into their collection, and vise
versa.&nbsp; This will allow you and/or the buyer the ability to have the firearm's past
and current details.&nbsp; If a firearm was known to need certain parts replaced after x
many rounds have been past through it, wouldn't it be nice to know how many rounds where
in it before you bought it?&nbsp; The option to export and import this history can help
with this issue.</p>
