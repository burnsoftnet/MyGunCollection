<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pictures allow you to store and display pictures of your
firearm, and or the accessories that you have for it. We do recommend that the first
picture you put in is that of your firearm.&nbsp; We only recommend this because to <a
href="Report_ForSale.htm">For Sale Flyer</a> uses the first picture that was inserted.
&nbsp; In later versions will will try to make it were you can choose which picture to
use, and or maybe more then one picture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not much to the pictures at this time, you can Add, Delete
and View Pictures from this section.</p>

<p>To View the picture, just double click on the picture to see the bigger version of it.</p>

<p><strong><big><a name="mainimg">Set as Main Image</a></big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Set as Main Image feature was added to version 3.x.&nbsp; This
will allow you to select the picture that you wish to display on the For Sale Flyer.
&nbsp; This Default Image setup will also be used on any future reports that are created
in later releases of the My Gun Collection application.&nbsp; In previous versions, the
first picture that you put in was the default image.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Pictures_Exporting_Image.jpg"

<p><strong><big><a name="iso">Image Sizing Options</a></big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Image Sizing Options where also release with Version 3.x. &nbsp;
In previous versions, when you click on the thumbnail to view the bigger version of the
picture, it would stretch the image to the current screen size.&nbsp; This wasn't a
problem with most hand gun pictures, but when you started viewing pictures of rifles which
are longer in width, it can be a bit annoying to constantly resize the picture.&nbsp; So
in version 3 we added the ability to give you the option on how you wish to view the
pictures.&nbsp; you can keep it stretched as in pervious versions or you can have it
attempt to keep the ratio of the picture for the current view.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Pictures_ImageSizing.jpg"
alt="Pictures_ImageSizing.jpg (14462 bytes)" width="344" height="142"></p>

<p>When you are viewing the big version of the picture, you can export that image to your
hard drive, or memory stick by right clicking on the picture and clicking on <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Image</em></font> and select either <font color="#0000FF">Original
Size</font> or <font color="#0000FF">Stretch</font>.&nbsp; You can also set that option of
Original Size and Stretch in the <a href="settings_other.htm">Other</a> Section located in
the Settings window.</p>

version 3)</p>
