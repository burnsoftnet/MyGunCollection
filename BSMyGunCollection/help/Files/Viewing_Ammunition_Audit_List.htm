<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to audit the cost of ammunition was added in version 4.
&nbsp; This allows you to keep track of how much you paid for that ammunition on the
purchase dates.&nbsp; Some people tend to mark the ammunition boxes with the date it was
bought, in order to cycle out old ammunition and some will mark it as the date it was
bought and would sell that ammunition.&nbsp; The audit will allow people to know how much
they paid for that ammunition based on the date.&nbsp; Others will use it to see the
fluctuation of ammunition prices over the years.</p>

<p>To Access the Ammunition Audit List, you will need to be viewing the ammunition
inventory list.&nbsp; Select the ammunition that you are interested and click on the
following icon on the tool bar <img src="images/ammoaudit_32_x_32.gif"
