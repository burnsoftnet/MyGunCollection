<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Maintenance window will display all the maintance that you have
done on the selected firearm since the time that you aquired it or since the time that you
have been using this application. Adding maintenance details is useful if you want to take
care of your firearms.&nbsp; By keeping track of when you use it how you clean it after it
is use is important to help maintain proper functionality of the firearm(s).&nbsp; If you
are a collector or regular shooter, then knowing when the last time the firearm was used,
cleaned with a silicon cloth or oiled is important.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In Version 3.x we've added what we like to call &quot;Fun Stats&quot;.&nbsp; It more of
a quick and easy look to see totals and averages of the screen that you are viewing.
&nbsp; For the Maintenance section, we've added the ability to see the total number of
rounds that have been fired from the selected firearm and even give the average of times
that the firearm has been fired every time you use it.&nbsp; This, of course, is based on
the information that you provide by adding information in the Maintenance section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add information to the maintance log, just click on the <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Add</em></font> button to bring up then <em>Add Maintance Details</em>
window.&nbsp; <a href="Adding_Maintance_Details.htm">Click here</a> for more information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wanted to print out a report of this information, you can
