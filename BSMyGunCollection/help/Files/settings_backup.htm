<p>When you first started this application it asked you for your information.&nbsp; The
Settings section is that same window that you saw when you first started this application.
&nbsp; To Access the settings window, just click on <font color="#0000ff"><em>Tools</em></font>,
then <font color="#0000ff"><em>Settings </em></font><font color="#000000">on the Menu Bar.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">From the Settings window, you are also set it up to help you keep
track of your backups.&nbsp; In the Backup tab, you have the options of</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000">Having the application Alert you if the last backup is greater
    then x amount of days.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Have it delete backups that are older then x amount of days</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">And Set the x number of days that you want to be alerted on and
    for it to keep newer backups from the last amount of days.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Settings_Backup.jpg" alt="Settings_Backup.jpg (20417 bytes)" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="292"></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Just Click on the Check Boxes to set the </font><font color="#0000FF">Alert on Last Backup Time, Backup on Exit</font><font color="#000000"> and
</font><font color="#0000FF">Automatically Delete Old Backups</font><font color="#000000">.</font></p>

<p>The Backup on Exit was added in Version 3.x.&nbsp; This will allow you to backup the
database everytime when you exit the My Gun Collection application.&nbsp; This is just a
safety feature if you want to have the latest and greatest copy of your database.</p>

<p>By Default, it will alert and track the last 30 days, which you can set to a longer or
shorter time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: As a safety precaution, it will keep the last 6 backups even if they are
greater then the set number of days.&nbsp; Since sometimes we are not able to add
information about our gun collection for a month or longer, it would be pointless to
delete all the backups if we haven't had the need to use the this application for a few
months.</strong></p>

<p>Once you are Finished, you can click on <em><font color="#0000FF">Apply</font></em> to
save the changes or you can click on <em><font color="#0000FF">Save</font></em> to Save
the Changes and exit the settings section.</p>
