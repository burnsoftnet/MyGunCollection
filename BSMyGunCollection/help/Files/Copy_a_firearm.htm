<p>This section will tell you how to copy a firearm.&nbsp; Sometimes we may get another or
newer version of a firearm that we have in our collection.&nbsp; Even though the specs for
the firearm are pretty much the same, it is still a pain to fill out all the information
again.&nbsp; So to help with this issue, we added the ability to copy the details of a
previous firearm. </p>

<p>At the Main screen, <font color="#0000FF">Click</font> once to highlight the firearm
that you wish to copy from the firearm list located on the left hand side..</p>

<p>Then <font color="#0000FF">right click</font> on the selected firearm to bring up the
following menu.</p>

<p><img src="images/CopyFirearm_CopyMenu.jpg" alt="CopyFirearm_CopyMenu.jpg (9744 bytes)" width="242" height="150"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Click on <font color="#0000FF"><em>Copy Firearm</em></font> to bring up the following
window:</p>

<p><img src="images/CopyFirearm_AddingInformation_1.jpg"
alt="CopyFirearm_AddingInformation_1.jpg (101550 bytes)" width="629" height="567"></p>

<p>As you can See this is the same as Clicking on the <a
href="Starting_out_Adding_A_Firearm.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><em>Add Firearm</em></font></a>
Button, except that it has copied all the information from the selected firearm to this
new one.&nbsp; All you have to do now is Type in the Serial Number and change any other
information that you feel needs to be changed.</p>

<p>Once you are finished adding or correcting information, click on the <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Add Firearm to My Collection</em></font> button to add this firearm to
the collection.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:&nbsp; When you copy a Firearm that has the Same Model name, it will
appear Twice on the Side list on the Main Window.<br>

<p><strong>This might cause issues if you had to quickly look up something and pull up the
wrong firearm.&nbsp; We recommend that you Add to the Model Name to help make it easy for
you to recognize which firearm is which.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As shown in the Instructions above, I've added &quot;Target&quot; to the
Walther P22 to help distinguish one from the other.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you had to Copy Accessories from the original firearm to the new one, make
sure you know which one you are copying to.&nbsp; One HINT that might help is that the
Copy form for Accessories list the firearms in the order in which they where entered, so
if I was going to copy an accessory from my first Glock to the new one, then I would have
to select the last Glock in the list.&nbsp; EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
