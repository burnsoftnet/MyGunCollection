<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In version 1.x and 2.x in order to lock the application, you can set
a password in the Settings section for the application so when the next time you ran the
application, it will ask you for a username and password (See <a href="Tools_Logging_in.htm">Logging In</a> Instructions for more details ).&nbsp; Only
problem with that method it that the default user name was &quot;admin&quot;&nbsp; which
was forgot our just unknow to those that used it.&nbsp; Since we try to make this
application more personal to you, we got rid of the default &quot;admin&quot; user name
and allow you to create your own username as well as a password.&nbsp; In the older
Versions of My Gun Collection, the Second Tab in the Settings window was called
&quot;Password&quot;, which has been changed to &quot;Security&quot; in version 3.x.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To access the security settings, just click on the tab marked
&quot;Security&quot; in the settings window ( to learn how to access the settings, <a href="Tools_Settings.htm">click here</a> )</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Settings_password.jpg" alt="Settings_password.jpg (24974 bytes)" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="306"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To start using the security feature, just click on the <font color="#0000FF">Enable
Security</font> check box to enabled the login name and password(s) text box.</p>

<p>Once the&nbsp; login name and password(s) text boxes are enabled, type in the username
that you wish to use and type the password twice.&nbsp; Twice to make sure you have the
typed the password correctly since you will not be able to see what you typed in.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The UserName is not required, but the password is.&nbsp; If you do not type in a user
name, the default &quot;admin&quot; will be used.</p>

<p>Now just incase you forget your password, we now have a &quot;Forgot Password&quot;
feature on the login screen.&nbsp; The Forgot Password Phrase and Word fields are
required!&nbsp; Type in the Phrase that you wish to use, and the word that is the answer.
&nbsp; It doesn't exactly have to be 1 word, you can have the rest of the phrase sentence
in the word section.&nbsp; Just as long as it is something that you can remember.</p>

<p>Once you have created the username and password that you wish to use, click on the <font color="#0000FF">Save</font> or <font color="#0000FF">Apply</font> button to save your
changes.&nbsp; Now next time that you run the program it will ask you for a username and
password ( see <a href="Tools_Logging_in.htm">Logging in</a> for more details ).</p>
