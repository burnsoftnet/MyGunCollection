<p>The FirearmComplete Detailed Report is a printer friendly way of printing out all the
specs for the selected firearm.&nbsp;It's the same as the <a href="report_fulldetails.htm">Full
Detailed Report</a>, but it will include more.&nbsp; It will use the first picture or
default picture that you assigned to that firearm as the display picture, then it will
print out all the details that you would first see when you click on the firearm. It will
also include all the Accessories, Maintenance and Gun Smith Details that has
occured.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To view this report, you can either click on the firearm in the main list, and right
click to bring up the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="images/Main_FirearmList_Menu.jpg"

<p>And select View Complete Detailed Report to view the report listed below.&nbsp; Or
while you are viewing the details of the firearm, you can click on the brown printer icon
( <img src="images/BigPrinter_1_32x32.gif" alt="BigPrinter_1_32x32.gif (884 bytes)" width="32" height="32"> ) in
the tool bar to view the following report.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see it is how the report will look when you print it out.&nbsp; To print out
the report, just click on the Printer icon ( <img src="images/Report_PrintIcon.jpg"
alt="Report_PrintIcon.jpg (895 bytes)" width="26" height="22"> ) that is located on the menu bar on the report,
once you click on that the Print Options will appear:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Report_PrintOptions.jpg"

<p>Select the Printer that you want this report to go to, and click on the <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Print</em></font> button.&nbsp; And that's it!</p>

<p>Of course you also have the option to save the report to an Excel or PDF file.&nbsp; To
