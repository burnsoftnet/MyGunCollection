<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you click on the <font color="#0000FF"><em>Mark Item as Sold</em></font>
from the details window of the selected firearm, it will bring up the following window:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Seller_information_blank.jpg"

<p>Fill In the Information listed, for your safety, we recommend that you fill out all the
information, just in case local or federal law enforcement need that information just
incase this weapon was used in a crime in the future.&nbsp; That firearm can be traced
back to you if you purchased it through a local gun shop, therefore, if you turned around
and sold it to someone else, at least you can say that this firearm was sold to this
person, on this date, and here is the information that I have from that person at that
time.</p>

<p>If this is a person or store that you have sold firearms to in the past, then Select
them from the <em>Use Previous Buyer</em> list and click on the <em><font color="#0000FF">Apply</font></em>
button to have it auto fill the information.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Seller_information_Filled.jpg"
alt="Adding_Seller_information_Filled.jpg (38403 bytes)" width="357" height="541"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have all the information filled out, click on the <font color="#0000FF"><em>Finish
Sale</em></font> button to mark this firearm as sold.</p>

<p>The Side list will refresh and the firearm that you just sold will now appear in the
&quot;Sold&quot; section of the firearm list.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Adding_Seller_information_SoldList.jpg"
alt="Adding_Seller_information_SoldList.jpg (4384 bytes)" width="170" height="94"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can still double to view the information for that firearm, if you go to the <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Buyer Details</em></font> section you will noticed all the fields will
have information about the person that bought this firearm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in case you were testing this function out, or that you got the
gun back from the person, you can click on the <font color="#0000FF"><em>Undo Sale</em></font>
button to put this item back in your collection and remove the buyer from this firearm.</p>
