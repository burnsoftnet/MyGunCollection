# Maintenance

![](images/ViewFullDetails_Maintance.jpg)

The Maintenance window will display all the maintenance that you have done on the selected firearm since the time that you acquired it or since the time that you have been using this application. Adding maintenance details is useful if you want to take care of your firearms.  By keeping track of when you use it how you clean it after it is use is important to help maintain proper functionality of the firearm(s).  If you are a collector or regular shooter, then knowing when the last time the firearm was used, cleaned with a silicon cloth or oiled is important. 

In Version 3.x we've added what we like to call "Fun Stats".  It more of a quick and easy look to see totals and averages of the screen that you are viewing.   For the Maintenance section, we've added the ability to see the total number of rounds that have been fired from the selected firearm and even give the average of times that the firearm has been fired every time you use it.  This, of course, is based on the information that you provide by adding information in the Maintenance section.

To add information to the maintenance log, just click on the Add button to bring up then Add Maintenance Details window.  [Click here](Adding_Maintance_Details.md) for more information.
