# Firearm For Sale Flyer

The For Sale Flyer is a printer friendly way of printing out a For Sale Flyer for the selected firearm.  It will use the first picture that you assigned to that firearm as the display picture, next it will list the Full Name of the Firearm, the Asking Priced (Which is based off the Apprised Priced), the Model, Brand/Manufacture, the Type, Caliber, and Condition of the firearm.  It will Also use the Name and Phone number that you supplied for the personal information when you first started the program (See Settings for more information on personal info).  To get the Flyer, just go to the Buyer Details section on the firearm details, and click on the Print Preview Flyer to bring up the following window:
