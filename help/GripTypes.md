# Managing Grip Types

Since the Grips Types are stored in the database and are mostly used when adding a firearm, we have now added the ability for you to be able to edit, delete and add Grip types to the database.

**NOTE:  This method of deleting/removing a Grip Type from the Collection is not as smart as using the Database Clean-up utility.  This will delete it even if it is in use by one of your firearms.  We heavily recommend that run the Database Clean-Up utility to remove all the Grip Types that are not Used in your collection if you wish to remove grip types that are not in use in your collection.**
