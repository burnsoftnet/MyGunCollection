The Buyer Details is a quick view of who you sold this firearm to.   If you have not sold this firearm, the information will remain blank.  But just in case you did want to sell this firearm, we have created a few options for you.

The Print Preview Flyer button will create a printer friendly flyer for you to post up at the local gun shop or shooting range.  [Click here](Report_ForSale.md) for more information about the For Sale Flyer.

The Mark Item As Sold button will allow you to Mark this Item as sold and will also allow you to put in the Buyers information. [Click here](Adding_Buyer_Information.md) for more information on how to add a buyer and mark the firearm as Sold.
