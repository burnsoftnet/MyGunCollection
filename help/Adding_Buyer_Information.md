Fill In the Information listed, for your safety, we recommend that you fill out all the information, just in case local or federal law enforcement need that information just incase this weapon was used in a crime in the future.  That firearm can be traced back to you if you purchased it through a local gun shop, therefore, if you turned around and sold it to someone else, at least you can say that this firearm was sold to this person, on this date, and here is the information that I have from that person at that time.

If this is a person or store that you have sold firearms to in the past, then Select them from the Use Previous Buyer list and click on the *Apply* button to have it auto fill the information.
