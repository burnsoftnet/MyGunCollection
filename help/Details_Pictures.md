# Pictures

![](images/ViewFullDetails_Pictures.jpg)

 The Pictures allow you to store and display pictures of your firearm, and or the accessories that you have for it. We do recommend that the first picture you put in is that of your firearm.  We only recommend this because the [For Sale Flyer](Report_ForSale.md) uses the first picture that was inserted.   In later versions will will try to make it were you can choose which picture to use, and or maybe more then one picture.

There is not much to the pictures at this time, you can Add, Delete and View Pictures from this section.

To View the picture, just double click on the picture to see the bigger version of it.

All you have to do now is click on the Add button to add it to the database.

The Picture Name and Notes about the picture is optional.  But since the Version 5.x release we thought it would be useful to have notes and titles about the pictures, not only for your own reminders but also for the Gallery Report.

If you add a title and Notes, it will Also appear when put your mouse over the main picture.

## Set as Main Image

The Set as Main Image feature was added to version 3.x.  This will allow you to select the picture that you wish to display on the For Sale Flyer.   This Default Image setup will also be used on any future reports that are created in later releases of the My Gun Collection application.  In previous versions, the first picture that you put in was the default image.

When you are viewing the big version of the picture, you can export that image to your hard drive, or memory stick by right clicking on the picture and clicking on Set As Main Image.

## Image Sizing Options

The Image Sizing Options where also release with Version 3.x.   In previous versions, when you click on the thumbnail to view the bigger version of the picture, it would stretch the image to the current screen size.  This wasn't a problem with most hand gun pictures, but when you started viewing pictures of rifles which are longer in width, it can be a bit annoying to constantly resize the picture.  So in version 3 we added the ability to give you the option on how you wish to view the pictures.  you can keep it stretched as in pervious versions or you can have it attempt to keep the ratio of the picture for the current view.

![](images/Pictures_ImageSizing.jpg)

When you are viewing the big version of the picture, you can export that image to your hard drive, or memory stick by right clicking on the picture and clicking on Image and select either Original Size or Stretch.  You can also set that option of Original Size and Stretch in the Other Section located in the Settings window.

Stretched Picture Example ( what Version 1 and 2 looked like, and is now optional in version 3)
