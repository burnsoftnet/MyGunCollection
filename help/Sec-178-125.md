(f) Firearms receipt and disposition by licensed collectors. * * *  In addition, the licensee shall--    
(1) Cause the transferee, if other than a licensee, to be  identified in any manner customarily used in commercial transactions  (e.g., a driver's license), and note on the record the method used, and    
(2) In the case of a transferee who is an alien legally in the  United States and who is other than a licensee--    
    (i) Verify the identity of the transferee by examining an   identification document (as defined in Sec. 178.11), and    
    (ii) Cause the transferee to present documentation establishing   that the transferee is a resident of the State (as defined in  Sec. 178.11) in which the licensee's business premises is located if  the firearm curio or relic is other than a shotgun or rifle, and note  on the record the documentation used or is a resident of any State and  has resided in such State continuously for at least 90 days prior to  the transfer of the firearm if the firearm curio or relic is a shotgun   or rifle and shall note on the record the documentation used. Examples  of acceptable documentation include utility bills or a lease agreement  which show that the transferee has resided in the State continuously  for at least 90 days prior to the transfer of the firearm curio or  relic.
